The package <code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.examples.dpp</code> provides a data processing
pipeline example to show the use of plug-ins to add new functionalities to
components with a form of mixins.
</p>
<p>
The example is first programmed without plug-ins in the following packages:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.examples.dpp.components</code> contains
  generic component definitions directly implementing the data flow among
  them;</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.examples.dpp.connections</code> contains the
  ports and connectors used by the generic components;</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.examples.dpp.example</code> contains a simple
  example showing how to use the generic components.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.examples.dpp.interfaces</code> contains the
  interfaces used by the data processing pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Then, the package <code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.examples.dpp.withPlugins</code>
and its subpackages reimplement the data processing pipeline using plug-ins. The
idea is to show how orthogonal functionalities can be added to components using
a form of mixins. This reimplementation is programmed in the following packages,
reusing much of the above definitions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.examples.dpp.withPlugins.plugins</code>
  contains the three plug-ins, one for the emission of the data pieces, one for
  the reception of data pieces as a data sink and one for the reception of
  data pieces that must be processed by a host processing component;</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.examples.dpp.withPlugins.connections</code>
  contains the inbound port redefined to use the plug-ins;</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.examples.dpp.withPlugins.example</code>
  contains the same simple example but implemented with plug-ins.</li>
</ul>
