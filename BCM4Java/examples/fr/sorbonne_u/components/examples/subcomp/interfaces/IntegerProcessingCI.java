/**
 * The class <code>Processing</code>
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Nota: since Java 8, Oracle jdk release 241, methods inherited by a remote
 * interface are no longer considered remote if the inherited interface is
 * not itself remote; to bypass this, methods must be redefined in the remote
 * method. Marking them with {@code @Override} stresses the design objective to
 * share identical signatures between the implementation interface and the
 * component interface.
 * </p>

 * <p><strong>Invariant</strong></p>
