This package provides a limited form of inter-component asynchronous calls with
future for BCM. The salient characteristics of this plug-in are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>calls themselves use a Command pattern where all calls are instances of
  a class extending <code>AbstractAsyncCall</code>;</li>
<li>calls as instances of <code>AbstractAsyncCall</code> subclasses are
  passed to the server component through the <code>AsyncCallCI</code>
  component interface and its <code>asyncCall</code> method;</li>
<li>results are returned to the client component through the
  <code>AsyncCallResultReceptionCI</code> component interface and its
  <code>acceptResult</code> method;</li>
<li>client and server components that wish to use asynchronous calls do
  so by installing the <code>AsyncCallClientPlugin</code> and
  <code>AsyncCallServerPlugin</code> respectively;</li>
<li>when performing an asynchronous call with the <code>asyncCall</code>
  method offered by <code>AsyncCallClientPlugin</code>, client components code
  gets a local future variable to hold the result that can be used to
  synchronise with its reception.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Conceptually, in Java, an asynchronous call would return a future variable upon
which the caller can synchronise over the return of the result of its call
when necessary. It indeed allows the caller to perform some operations after
the asynchronous call until it needs the result of this call, and therefore
providing some parallelism between the caller and the callee.
</p>
<p>
Calls between BCM components cannot directly use standard Java future objects
because they may be done with RMI and Java future objects are not serialisable.
Here, we use the following idea:.
</p>
<ol>
<li>the caller performs the calls as an asynchronous one using a predefined
  interface called <code>AsyncCallCI</code> that passes a representation of
  the original call as a command;</li>
<li>the command holds information to send the result back to the caller
  component, namely the URI of an inbound port offering the
  <code>AsyncCallResultReceptionCI</code>, through which it can send back the
  result when available;</li>
<li>when the call has finished on the server side, it sends the result using
  again a standard asynchronous call <i>i.e.</i>, without future;</li>
<li>the caller receives the result and sets a completable future that was
  created (and immediately returned to the calling code) when the
  asynchronous call was performed.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In Java, completable future can be used to cancel an asynchronous computation.
Here, as the call can be made on a distant server component, cancellation is
not implemented. Hence, a specific <code>RemoteCompletableFuture</code> is
provided which throws an exception if one tries to cancel a computation with
it.
</p>
<p>
This package defines the component interfaces, their ports and connectors, as
well as two plug-ins for the client side and the server side respectively, and
an abstract class for the Command pattern. A simple test of the plug-ins is
provided as an example of its usage.
