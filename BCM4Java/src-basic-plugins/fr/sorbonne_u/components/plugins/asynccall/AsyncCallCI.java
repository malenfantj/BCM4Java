/**
 * The component interface <code>AsyncCallCI</code> defines the signature to be
 * used to perform an asynchronous call.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The call itself is represented by a Command pattern where the abstract
 * class <code>AbstractAsyncCall</code> is inherited by all user command
 * classes. All such command instances have an URI for each call so that
 * the result can be sent back to the caller by another asynchronous call
 * with this URI and the result as parameters. Hence, the caller can know
 * to which call correspond which result.
