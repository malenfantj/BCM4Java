/**
 * The interface <code>EndPointI</code> defines an end point connecting two
 * software entities through an interface {@code I} in an
 * implementation-agnostic manner.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An end point embed a reference to be used to connect two entities, a caller
 * and a callee. The protocol is to create the end point (with appropriate
 * implementation-dependent information that is shared among the caller and
 * the callee). The protocol is then:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create the end point, providing the implementation-dependent information
 *   required by its actual implementation.</li>
 * <li>Pass a copy of the end point both to the server and client sides,
 *   using the method {@code copyWithSharable} to create the appropriate
 *   copies with the sharable information only.</li>
 * <li>On the server side: call {@code initialiseServerSide} passing it a
 *   reference to the server side software entity; this must perform whatever
 *   implementation-dependent actions required to establish the connection
 *   on the server side.</li>
 * <li>On the client side: after the initialisation on the server side, call
 *   {@code initialiseClientSide} passing it a reference to the client side
 *   software entity; this will perform whatever implementation-dependent
 *   actions required to establish the connection from the client side.</li>
 * <li>On the client side: call {@code getReference} to get the reference
 *   implementing the interface {@code I} through which the server side
 *   methods can be called as long as needed.</li>
 * <li>On the client side: when the end point is no longer needed, call
 *   {@code cleanUpClientSide}; this will perform whatever
 *   implementation-dependent actions required to cut the connection
 *   on the client side.</li>
 * <li>On the server side: when the end point is no longer needed, call
 *   {@code cleanUpServerSide}; this will perform whatever
 *   implementation-dependent actions required to cut the connection
 *   on the server side.</li>
