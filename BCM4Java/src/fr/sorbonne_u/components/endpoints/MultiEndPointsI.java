/**
 * The interface <code>MultiEndPointsI</code> defines the signatures of methods
 * that a multiple end points implementation must provide; a multiple end points
 * provides a way to group together many end points defined for distinct
 * implemented interfaces connecting a single client software entity to a
 * single server software entity.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The multiple end points is meant to ease the passage of information among a
 * caller and a callee when the caller use many distinct interfaces to call the
 * callee. Compared to a single end point, it reuses all of the signatures
 * defined in {@code AbstractEndPointI} to perform the corresponding actions
 * on all of its embedded end points at once, and it provides a method
 * {@code getEndPoint} to retrieve a single end point from its implemented
 * interface.
