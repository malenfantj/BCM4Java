This package defines accelerated clocks and clocks server components which
purpose is to simplify the implementation of time-triggered test scenarios for
BCM4Java applications.
</p>
<p><i>Work in progress...</i></p>
<p>
Accelerated clocks are clock that can manage multiple time lines in synchrony.
In the current implementations, the class <code>AcceleratedClock</code> maintains
the time line of Unix epoch current time and a time line defined by the Java
standard class <code>Instant</code>, with an acceleration factor that can shrink
the <code>Instant</code> onto the Unix epoch time line so that a time-triggered
test scenario can be defined in an <code>Instant</code> time line and executed
in real time but in much less time than an actual real time execution would.
For example, a scenario that would take a day to execute in actual real time
can be accelerated to execute within minutes.
</p>
<p>
The major issue when performing accelerated time-triggered test scenarios is to
synchronise actions among multiple possibly distributed components. Real time
executions can be accelerated to execute faster than actual real time yet
maintaining a linear relationship with the actual real time. If the same
acceleration factor used to map instants to Unix epoch time and a base start
time by all components, be them distributed, it becomes possible to maintain
the synchrony between scheduled actions in the program at given time instants.
</p>
<p>
<code>AcceleratedClock</code> is therefore instantiated with a Unix epoch start
time and a start <code>Instant</code> providing a first point of synchronisation
between the two time lines. It is also given an acceleration factor. The class
then provides methods to compute the instant corresponding to some (<i>e.g.</i>,
current) Unix epoch time (happening after the start) and the Unix epoch time
corresponding to some (<i>e.g.</i>, current) instant. It also provides methods
to compute the delay in Unix epoch time until some instant so that this delay
can be used with standard Java scheduling methods defined on Java standard
scheduled executor services. Hence, if a scenario calls for the execution of an
action in software at some instant I in the future, these methods returns a
delay at which this action must be scheduled to occur at the right real time
to synchronise with the simulation.
</p>
<p>
The class <code>ClocksServer</code> implements a component that allows to share
accelerated clocks among several components, even distributed. The component
provides a service to create a new clock and a service to retrieve a
previously created clock. As the accelerated clock time evolution is based on
the hardware clock of the clock host, copies of the same clock (with the same
start time, start instant and acceleration factor) will provide the same
results to the same method calls. Indeed, when used in a distributed execution,
this is true only to the extent at which the clocks of the different hosts are
themselves kept in synchrony. The precision at which the synchronisation
between the copies of a clock is maintained is therefore limited to the
precision and synchronisation of their underlying hardware clocks.
